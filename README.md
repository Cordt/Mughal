# Mughal

Mughal is a image-optimization and -conversion library for any kind of swift application. It focusses on web-applications and websites that support different devices and want to optimise the user-experience by providing the right image type, quality and size at the right time and context.

## Help

If you want to support the development of this library or are looking for features to add, feel free to open a PR.

## Credits and thanks

Mughal uses several librariers that do the havy-lifting in terms of image processing:
* [libwebp by Google](https://github.com/webmproject/libwebp)

The mapping of the libwebp library to work well in Swift was strongly inspired by [Swift-WebP](https://github.com/ainame/Swift-WebP). If you want to use WebP in iOS or MacOS applications, this is definitely the library you should choose.
